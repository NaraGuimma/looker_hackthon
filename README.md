# Looker Hackathon: Exploring Biodiversity Insights 🌿🔍

Welcome to my Looker project, where data meets the beauty of nature! 🌎🌳 In this repository, I've delved into the fascinating world of biodiversity using Looker and LookML. The chosen dataset, **Biodiversity**, is a treasure trove of information about the rich flora and fauna found in parks across the United States.

## Why Biodiversity?

As someone passionate about nature, hailing from the biodiverse landscapes of Brazil, I couldn't resist the allure of exploring the intricate tapestry of life within US parks. The dataset not only resonates with my love for the environment but also presents a captivating opportunity to showcase the power of Looker in unraveling insights.

## Features Snapshot 📸

### 1. Interactive Map of Parks
Marvel at the geographical distribution of parks across states in the US. The dashboard features an interactive map, providing a visual feast of the parks' locations and a count of parks in each state.

### 2. Pivot Table Magic
Dive deep into the details with a dynamic pivot table. The first column elegantly displays parks, while species names gracefully pivot, revealing the biodiversity within each park. It's a data-driven symphony of information!

### 3. Top-Notch Filters
Navigate seamlessly through the dataset using two powerful filters:
- **Filter by State Name:** Zoom in on specific states to uncover their unique biodiversity.
- **Filter by Park:** Drill down into individual parks to explore the variety of species they host.
